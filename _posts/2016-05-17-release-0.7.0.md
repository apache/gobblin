Welcome to the new Gobblin 0.7.0 release. Here you can find information about new features, bug fixes, and other improvements. New artifacts are available at Maven Central for [here](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cgobblin-0.7.0).

## Highlights

* Gobblin has deprecated support for Hadoop 1.x.x - Gobblin will build with Hadoop 2.3.0 by default, and will throw an exception if users try to build against 1.x.x versions
* Gobblin can now write data to Relational Databases via a new `JDBCWriter`; the Writer is capable of writing to any RDMS connectable via JDBC, however, our testing has focused on writing to MySQL
    * Documentation: http://gobblin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/Gobblin-JDBC-Writer/
* Gobblin can now automatically register published datasets into Hive
    * Documentation: http://gobblin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/Hive-Registration/
* Gobblin has a new adaptor that can do a distributed copy of data between Hadoop clusters (many improvements over Hadoop's Distcp Tool); it can also has upcoming support for replicating Hive tables between different Metastores
    * Documentation: http://gobblin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adaptors/Gobblin-Distcp/
* Gobblin has a new configuration management system that is focused on configuring datasets in a reliable and sensible way; the system is largely based on Typesafe's Config library
    * Documentation: http://gobblin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/Config-Management/
