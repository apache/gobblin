Welcome to the new Gobblin 0.10.0 release. Here you can find information about new features, bug fixes, and other improvements. New artifacts are available at Maven Central for [here](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cgobblin-0.10.0).


## HIGHLIGHTS 

* Gobblin-as-a-Service: Global orchestrator with REST API for submitting logical flow specifications. Logical flow specifications compile down to physical pipeline specs (Gobblin Jobs) that can run on one or more heterogeneous Gobblin deployments.
* Gobblin Throttling: Library and service to enforce global usage policies by various processes or applications. For example, Gobblin throttling allows limiting the aggregate QPS to a single Database of all MR applications.
* Gobblin Stream Mode: This release introduces support for running streaming ingestion pipelines that include all the standard Gobblin pipeline capabilities (converters, forks etc). Streaming sources (Kafka) and sinks (Kafka, Couchbase, Eventhub) are included.
* Gobblin compliance: Including functionality for purging datasets, Gobblin Compliance module allows for data purging to meet regulatory compliance requirements. (https://gobblin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/Gobblin-Compliance/)
* New Writers: Couchbase (PR 1433), EventHub (PR 1537). 
* New Sources: Azure Data Lake (PR 1764)
