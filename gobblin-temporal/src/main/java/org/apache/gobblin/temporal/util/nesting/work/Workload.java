/**
 * {@link Workload} models a logical collection of homogenous inputs over which a "foreach" operation can asynchronously apply
 * an arbitrary procedure to each element.  This encapsulates "processing" the entire collection of sequential
 * "work item" specifications by the uniform application of the chosen procedure(s).
 *
 * Given Temporal's required determinism, the work items and work spans should remain unchanged, with stable sequential
 * ordering.  This need not constrain `Workload`s to eager, advance elaboration: "streaming" definition is possible,
 * so long as producing a deterministic result.
 *
 * A actual, real-world workload might correspond to datastore contents, such as records serialized into HDFS files
 * or ordered DB query results.
