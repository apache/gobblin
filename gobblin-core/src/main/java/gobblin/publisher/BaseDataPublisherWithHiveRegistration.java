/**
 * An extension of {@link BaseDataPublisher} which performs Hive registration after publishing data.
 *
 * <p>
 *   This publisher should generally be used as the job level data publisher, since doing Hive registration
 *   in tasks may need to create many Hive metastore connections if the number of tasks is large. To publish
 *   data in tasks and do Hive registration in the driver, one should use
 *   {@link BaseDataPublisher} as the task level publisher and
 *   {@link HiveRegistrationPublisher} as the job level publisher.
