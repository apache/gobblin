# By specifying these converters, Gobblin will take each record returned by SftpSource, split each record by some delimiter, and then convert the record to an Avro record

# Source connection properties
# The current implementation of SftpSource only allows Gobblin to authenticate to the Sftp Server via public-key authentication. This requires a private key file and a known hosts file
