/**
 * An implementation of {@link Limiter} that limits the rate of some events. This implementation uses
 * Guava's {@link RateLimiter}.
 *
 * <p>
 *   {@link #acquirePermits(long)} is blocking and will always return {@link true} after the permits
 *   are successfully acquired (probably after being blocked for some amount of time). Permit refills
 *   are not supported in this implementation. Also {@link #acquirePermits(long)} only accepts input
 *   arguments that can be safely casted to an integer bounded by {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE}.
