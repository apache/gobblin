GOBBLIN 0.6.1
=============

## BUG FIXES

- **Build/release** Adding build instrumentation for generation of rest-api-* artifacts
- **Build/release** Various fixes to decrease reliance of unit tests on timing.

## OTHER IMPROVEMENTS

- **Core** Add stability annotations for APIs. We plan on starting to annotate interfaces/classes to specify how likely the API is to change.
- **Runtime** Made it an option for the job scheduler to wait for running jobs to complete
- **Runtime** Fixing dangling MetricContext creation in ForkOperator

## EXTERNAL CONTRIBUTIONS

- kadaan, joel.baranick:
  + Added a fix for a hadoop issue (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12169) which affects the s3a filesystem and results in duplicate files appearing in the results of ListStatus. In the process, extracted a base class for all FsHelper classes based on the hadoop filesystem.
