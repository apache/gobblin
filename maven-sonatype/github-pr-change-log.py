# Usage: Python Script that takes in a range of Gobblin Pull Request Numbers and outputs metadata about each Pull Request
#
# An example output would look like:
#
# * [] [PR 902] Make it possible to specify empty job data publisher
# * [] [PR 903] The underlying Avro CodecFactory only matches lowercase codecs, so weâ€¦
# * [] [PR 904] Fixed precondition check for overwriting in datapublisher
#
# The output of this script is meant for the CHANGELOG file that is updated before each Gobblin release.
# There is a pair of [] brackets at the beginning of the build which is meant to containg the project name the PR is related to
#
# The script should be run as follows "./pull-requests-change-log.py [github-username] [github-password] [starting-pr-number] [ending-pr-number]
# For example, to produce the above output the command run was "./pull-requests-change-log.py sahilTakiar [my-password] 900 905"
